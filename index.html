   <div class="poza1_stanga"><p1>Now, I am going to tell you shortly what I've done in Romania. 
Well...For three years, I've been in the town's athletics team called "Ceahlau".
I had the pleasure to be a volunteer at the European Researcher's Night and in 2019, 
to be the organizer student of the event. I enjoy drawing but unfortunately 
I left all my work in Romania. I listen to a lot of music and I hope I will join 
very soon to a music society.At this moment I am a student at Computer Science , 
at University of Sheffield. I enjoy beeing a student in Sheffield. This web-site will be about 
my degree and how much time  I do spend learning new programming languages. </p1>
